6. What is DOM in js?
Ans. DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a tree-like structure that represents the elements of a web page. The DOM is created by the browser when it loads a web page, and it is used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the elements of the page.
The DOM is made up of nodes, which are objects that represent the different elements of a web page. The most common types of nodes are elements, attributes, and text nodes.
