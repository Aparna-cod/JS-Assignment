Day4:

1. Create the Example for Logical Operators 
Ans. 
let a=10;
let b=90;
let c=100;
let result = c>a && c>b
console.log("is c the greatest among three of the number ;" + result)

let a=11;
let b=30;
console.log(a%2 == 0 || b%2 ==0)

let a = 1; 
console.log(!a);

2. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
Ans. 
- == is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable whereas === is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.
- == is called as comparison operator whereas === is also called as comparison operator.
- == Return true only if the two operands are equal while === returns true only if both values and data types are the same for the two variables.
- == in JavaScript is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable.	=== is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.

2. How many operators do we have in JS ?
Ans. There are different types of JavaScript operators:
-Arithmetic Operators
-Assignment Operators
-Comparison Operators
-String Operators
-Logical Operators
-Bitwise Operators
-Ternary Operators
-Type Operators

4.What is use of parseInt in js?
Ans. The JavaScript number parseInt() method parses a string argument and converts it into an integer value. 
With string argument, we can also provide radix argument to specify the type of numeral system to be used.
Syntax:
Number.parseInt(string, radix)  

5. Take input from user and find the odd and even number?

Ans. 
// program to check if the number is even or odd
// take input from the user
const number = prompt("Enter a number: ");

//check if the number is even
if(number % 2 == 0) {
    console.log("The number is even.");
}

// if the number is odd
else {
    console.log("The number is odd.");
}
